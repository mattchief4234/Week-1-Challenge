# <Prework Study Guide>

## I actually enojoyed making this and it pushed me harder than I would have liked. It challenged my knowledge of what was taught by the instructer and make me apply it. I also had to review my notes and look up how to do things that we were taught before. All in all, it was a good assignment to do and I am gladd that I did it.

## Installation

the required steps are as follows:
 Step 1) Develop the "bear bones" of the website using HTML. Input the correct informmation and where that infromatoin is to sit and in which order they are to be arranged.
 Step 2) Futher optimize that order from chaos using CSS. Give the website a cleaner and more user friendly look by inputting border and colors to specific lines of code. This also makes it much easier to read.
 Step 3) Make sure the Buttons and input from the user was working Properly. (this took me a while to do!)

## Usage

This website is not as usable as it looks, BUT it is a testiment to the new skills and knowledge that I gained while only 2 weeks in the class. I hope this make a website liek this in the future and acutally make it more usable.


## Credits

I want to thank the teachers, instructors and tutors at the University of Utah and their patience in not only creating this amazing course but in their patience and long suffereing in teaching me and helping me further understand beyond what they are trying to achieve. Teach how to do it, the application and also the thought process behind it.
